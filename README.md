Adding tasks: Users can add new tasks to their list by giving them a title and optionally a description or additional details.
Prioritization: Users can assign a priority to each task to indicate their relative importance or urgency.
Marking progress: Users can mark tasks as "to do", "in progress" or "done" to track their progress.
Due dates: Users can specify a due date for each task to manage deadlines.
Organization and Categorization: Users can organize their tasks by grouping them by project, category, or tags.
Notifications: Some ToDoList apps can send notifications or reminders to users to alert them of upcoming tasks or deadlines.
